When starting to work on the project for the session (make sure on master branch using git checkout master)-- git pull origin master
This is to make sure your local version matches repository in case someone made changes in the meantime.

Then when you are adding new code, use checkout to switch branches so we don't add code to master that isn't
approved. -- git checkout -b name-of-branch (-b means make new branch)

Next is easy, just add and commit -- git add . or git add -A (https://gist.github.com/dsernst/ee240ae8cac2c98e7d5d visit this site for
a good explanation of the difference between . and -A)
--git commit -m "message description"

when done working on code for the session, push the non-master branch you worked on to the origin
-- git push origin name-of-branch

Go to the github repo for the project and click compare and pull request on the right. Then click green pull request button.
Make sure the next page says no conflicts with master branch, then merge pull request and confirm merge.

Finally delete your local branch -- git branch -d branch-name
